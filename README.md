# lottery --- WIP

# Project idea


    This came out as a university project which is supposed to demonstrate you that is almost impossible for you to win the biggest prize in lottery since you have to guess, in some kind of magic , all 6 winning numbers.
    
    It's actually simulating your chances to win something in case you play weekely.Let's say you'll play a ticket every week, and every week six numbers are drawn, considering you have to pay an amount of money every week for that ticket, it'll calculate the balance win-lose, mainly you'll lose money rather than winning something, also you'll notice that most of the time the chances are that you'll guess mostly only 3 numbers (if you're lucky) out of 6, since you have to make almost 13,983,816 combinations to guess all of them which for me it's seems impossible.
   
   So, there are 4 winning categories based on how many numbers you guess:
   * Category I : you're insanely lucky 'cause you've got 6/6
   * Category II : not as lucky as the first one but lucky enough to guess 5/6
   * Category III : you should feel lucky 'cause you'be got that far with 4/6 :four_leaf_clover:
   * Category IV : you'll get a sucky prize, but at list you've got something
